Treemaps are another great way to visualize hierarchical data.

This visualization shows the breakdown of each Nashville hospital into its separate healthcare units by total transaction count.

The size is based on the number of transactions while the color is based on the percentage of transactions within a given unit/specialty.

Think of each square as representation of the "Nashville healthcare market share."

**Key Takeaway: The continuous color palette makes it easy to identify which units have room to grow. Lighter color = more room for improvement while the darker color = less room for improvement.**
